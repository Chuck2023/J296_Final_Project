# Intersecting race and sexuality in California's looming Syphilis crisis 

### *In 2021, 40% of all cases of P&S syphilis were among non-Hispanic Black persons, even though they made up only approximately 18 percent of the US population. Further, almost 40% of MSM reported with P&S syphilis were Black.*

##### On any given day, Antonio Hardison, who prefers to be called Danny, is busy advising animal owners on proper nutrition, exercise, and other aspects of animal care - a job he considers a hobby for a dog lover. But for some weeks, he has been in and out of the Oakland LGBTQ center for his Syphilis treatment. Earlier this year, he took his final injection for a Syphilis infection that had recurred twice in just a year.
 
##### "I don't know what this is,” he said. “My nurse says I will be fine once I get the injection, but I'm back here again - it's reinfection or something.”
 
##### Danny, 30-year-old who works as a veterinarian in downtown Oakland , is part of a racial and sexual minority group experts say is affected by a disease that is on the rise nationally, with repeat infections happening among some groups in particular, according to recent research carried out by UCSF researchers. Some experts, like, Michael Rekart, MD, of the University of British Columbia, School of Population and Public Health say that the reason repeat syphilis is now on the rise is due to incomplete treatment, risky sexual behaviors, and because HIV treatment and prevention has eclipsed prevention of other STIs.
 
##### “The widespread availability of HIV treatment makes people believe the effects of HIV are less severe,” he said. “Antiretroviral drugs and PREP have let Syphilis on the loose.”
 
##### Nationally, Syphilis infection rates have been up by 70 percent since 2011, according to the CDC. Men who sleep with men (MSM) account for about 65 percent of these cases - chief obstacle to the goal of eliminating Syphilis in the United States. The data, which excludes non-binary populations, has men leading in all case loads from 2016 to 2020. 

##### "This is disturbing," said Dr. Stephanie Cohen of the AIDS Prevention Center in San Francisco. "We are seeing a high caseload statewide".

##### The California Department of Public Health has pinpointed Los Angeles and San Francisco as the counties with leading cases. In 2000, syphilis rates were so low that public health officials believed eradication was on the horizon. But rates are on the rise. From 2015 to 2019 alone. In California and the U.S., about half of syphilis cases are in men who have sex with men.

##### Several factors account for the rise in cases. Timothy Nguyen - a sexual health provider at the Oakland LGBTQ Center says more than a third of Black women in California who have syphilis also use meth, which has surged in recent years. These trends, he believes, have caused overall national cases of sexually transmitted diseases to hit an all-time high for the last six years in a row, reaching 2.5 million. 

##### "And the consequences are now trickling down to babies, who are contracting syphilis from their mothers," he said. "Congenital syphilis rates nearly quadrupled between 2012 and 2019."

### Case Load and Racial Disparities 

##### Overall, the data suggest disparities in the incidence of this condition across different racial/ethnic groups, with the Hispanic/Latino group and the White group having the highest number of reported cases. The data also indicates that there have been overall increases in reported cases across all groups from 2016 to 2019, followed by a slight decrease in 2020.

##### Regarding the change in reported cases from 2016 to 2020, the Asian/Pacific Islander group had the most significant increase, with a 24.3% rise in reported cases, while the Black/African American group had the smallest increase, with a 23.7% rise in reported cases. Meanwhile, the White group had the most significant absolute number of cases in all years but saw the smallest increase in reported cases from 2016 to 2020, with a 20.3% rise over the five years.

##### Data on repeat syphilis is scarce according to the California Department of Public Health, but syphilis is on the rise here and nationally, and California has the added problem of repeat syphilis due to local challenges. Experts like Oakland LGBTQ Center health care provider Timothy Nguyen say the long unrecognized problem is attributable to too few sexual health clinics locally, long wait times, insufficient time for patients to meet with providers, and stigma. As a result, people with syphilis don’t get the care they need, and the infection comes back again and again, especially for those who are Black and brown. 

##### “I am seeing the Black and Latinx community largely impacted by this,” said Nguyen. “Most patients with repeat syphilis are either Black or Latinx.”

##### Danny, a local patient who shares equal concern is worried about what this means for his community, as he himself has seen more and more of his friends with the disease. Even though local studies show California’s rate of syphilis relatively low for the black and community, Nguyen and others say those statistics, don’t line up with what they are seeing today in California.

##### A single injection of long-acting Benzathine penicillin G cures the early and late stages of Syphilis. CDC recommends three doses of long-acting Benzathine penicillin G at weekly intervals for late latent Syphilis or unknown duration. If left untreated, it can cause damage to the heart, brain and other organs.


### Data Analysis - Qualitative

##### As expert sources, I incorporated in the story quotes from three experts: [Michael Rekart, MD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5537507/), a Canadian-based infectious disease researcher,[Timothy Inguyen]((https://www.oaklandlgbtqcenter.org/staff), a health practitioner at the Glenn Center in Oakland, California and [Stephanie Cohen MD]((https://profiles.ucsf.edu/stephanie.cohen), lead researcher in sexual health at the University of San Francisco.

##### Datasets used for the analysis were sourced from the California Department of Public Health, STD Control Branch (data as reported through 3/22/2022), State of California, Department of Finance, Report P-3: State and County Population Projections by Race/Ethnicity, Detailed Age, and Gender, 2010-2060, Baseline 2019.  Sacramento, California, January 2020.The first database was compiled as .csv files here and the second, here.

##### Created a pivot table using Entity Country as row and (unique) client IDs and Sum of Entity Contribution as values.
Copied the resultant table and pasted it in a new tab. Sorted to find the highest values.
