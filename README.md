# Minority communities disproportionaley impacted by California's looming Syphilis crisis 

### *In 2021, 40% of all cases of P&S syphilis were among non-Hispanic Black persons, even though they made up only approximately 18 percent of the US population. Further, almost 40% of MSM reported with P&S syphilis were Black.*

### Story Draft

##### On any given day, Antonio Hardison, who prefers to be called Danny, is busy advising animal owners on proper nutrition, exercise, and other aspects of animal care - a job he considers a hobby for a dog lover. But for some weeks, he has been in and out of the Oakland LGBTQ center for his Syphilis treatment. Earlier this year, he took his final injection for a Syphilis infection that had recurred twice in just a year.
 
##### "I don't know what this is,” he said. “My nurse says I will be fine once I get the injection, but I'm back here again - it's reinfection or something.”
 
##### Danny, 30-year-old who works as a veterinarian in downtown Oakland , is part of a sexual minority group experts say is affected by a disease that is on the rise nationally, with repeat infections happening among some groups in particular, according to recent research carried out by UCSF researchers. Some experts, like, Michael Rekart, MD, of the University of British Columbia, School of Population and Public Health say that the reason repeat syphilis is now on the rise is due to incomplete treatment, risky sexual behaviors, and because HIV treatment and prevention has eclipsed prevention of other STIs.
 
##### “The widespread availability of HIV treatment makes people believe the effects of HIV are less severe,” he said. “Antiretroviral drugs and PREP have let Syphilis on the loose.”
 
##### Nationally, Syphilis infection rates have been up by 70 percent since 2011, according to the CDC. Men who sleep with men (MSM) account for about 65 percent of these cases - chief obstacle to the goal of eliminating Syphilis in the United States.
 
##### A single injection of long-acting Benzathine penicillin G cures the early and late stages of Syphilis. CDC recommends three doses of long-acting Benzathine penicillin G at weekly intervals for late latent Syphilis or unknown duration. If left untreated, it can cause damage to the heart, brain and other organs.
 
##### As expert sources, I incorporated in the story quotes from two individuals: [Michael Rekart, MD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5537507/), a Canadian-based infectious disease researcher, and Timothy Inguyen, a health practitioner at the Glenn Center in Oakland, California. 

##### Datasets used for the analysis were sourced from theCalifornia Department of Public Health, STD Control Branch (data as reported through 3/22/2022), State of California, Department of Finance, Report P-3: State and County Population Projections by Race/Ethnicity, Detailed Age, and Gender, 2010-2060, Baseline 2019.  Sacramento, California, January 2020.The first database was compiled as .csv files here and the second, here.
